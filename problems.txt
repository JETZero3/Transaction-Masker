Problems:
1. String formatting is non-constant
2. Variable names are non-constant
3. Strings might be incorrectly formed
4. Parsing by looking for specific phrases might catch unwanted data
5. Must be in same format as input string
6. Must be modular to changes (cannot hardcode just for CVV, CardNumber, and expiry date)
7. Could be more formats
